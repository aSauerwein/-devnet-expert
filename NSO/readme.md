# Network Services Orchestrator
## Blueprint Topics covered
2.10	Create a basic Cisco NSO service package to meet given business and technical requirements. The service would generate a network configuration on the target device platforms using the "cisco-ios-cli" NED and be of type "python-and-template"
2.10.a	Create a service template from a provided NSO device configuration
2.10.b	Create a basic YANG module for the service containers (including lists, leaf lists, data types, leaf references, and single argument "when" and "must" conditions)
2.10.c	Create basic actions to verify operational status of the service
2.10.d	Monitor service status by reviewing the NCS Python VM log file
